The M4 macro processor is used to generate arbitrarily complex code from simple source code.
The introductory part of the series contains its history, the basic principles of language, examples of usage and prerequisites for its mastery.

24
Introduction

30
Readers of this series will learn how to write scripts for machine code generation.
The machine-generated code can be arbitrarily complex and can contain other internal dependencies.
Interdependent files with complex code are hardly sustainable for humans in a consistent state.
It is necessary to use some code generation mechanism.
The code generation is performed by a tool for text transformation – a macro processor.

45
The series focus on the practical use of the universal macro processor M4 (hereafter M4) using small examples.
It also describes the theoretical part of all its implementations.
The aim of the series is to acquaint the reader with this tool (m4 – is a command line program) and also the programming language (M4 – is a programming language).
What is it used for, how to program in it and its advantages and disadvantages.

59
[note]

59
Multilingual series „Generating code in M4“ are generated by M4 scripts,
which will make it easier (maybe) for other authors to write articles on www.root.cz (Root.cz – information not only from the Linux world).
The result of the series is also a set of sample scripts for generating code.

61
The introductory part describes the basic principles of the language with simple examples of use.
All examples use rewriting rules of context-free grammar.
Later we will learn how to use output queues,
automata, associative memories, stacks and pushdown automata.
We will also learn how to write testing automata to test input data.

77
Examples for readers

83
The examples are a complementary part of the series and will be based to some extent on the discussion below the article.
At the beginning of each episode, some parts of the M4 language will be described and supplemented with a set of examples at the end.
Each part can be read in any order.

History of macro languages

119
Macro languages were invented when the assembly language (ASM) dominated.
ASM source code usually contains identical instruction sequences that differ only in operand values.
Identical instruction sequences can be grouped into one word or a macro instruction.
The name usually describes the purpose of the hidden sequence of instructions.
These macro instructions are translated by the macro processor to the original instruction sequences, which are then translated into the executable machine code.
Programming in ASM using macro instructions is simpler, faster and less prone to human errors.

136
Later, macro languages were used to extend compiled programming languages because they made it possible to write a source code at the higher level of abstraction than offered by the programming language itself.
The speed, performance and efficiency of a complex lower-level programming language is maintained through macro languages.
However, it is important to understand all layers of code well.

147
GPM (General Purpose Macro-generator)

151
Christopher Strachey (Wikipedia) introduced the basic idea of rewritable strings with arguments which recursively rewrite to other strings in his
GPM (General Purpose Macro-generator) in 1965.
The next generation of M3 and M4 macro processors basically just expanded the original GPM (General Purpose Macro-generator).
The basic idea of the original proposal remained the same.

165
M3

169
Dennis Ritchie (Wikipedia) took over the basic idea of GPM (General Purpose Macro-generator) and wrote an improved macro processor for generating source code of C (1972) language, which he himself designed.
The new macro processor was written for the minicomputer AP-3, hence the name M3.
This direct ancestor of the current M4 managed to significantly save heavy and time-consuming work and attract developers programming to other languages (FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), COBOL (COmmon Business-Oriented Language), PL/I (Programming Language One), …).
Developers have customized M3 for these languages turning it into a universally usable M4 macro processor.

182
[m4 ∈ {set of UNIX tools}]

182
Dennis Ritchie was also a co-creator of UNIX and therefore:

182
M4 is minimalist and fast, it does one thing and it does well (UNIX philosophy)

182
it relies solely on the non-interactive command line interface

182
parameters and dependencies of M4 scripts are described by 

182
the  character begins with a one-line comment like in a UNIX shell

182
variables , , , , , , … have similar meanings as in a UNIX shell

182
the argument delimiter is comma

239
The M3 macro processor was also extended by Jim E. Weythman, the author of program construction, which is used in almost every M4 script:

255
[note]

255
The (divert(-1), divert(0), divert(1), …, divert(2147483647)) keyword switches output queues.
Argument  completely disables any text output.
Argument  switches output to  (standard output).

266
M4

270
Brian Kernighan (Wikipedia) has enhanced the M3 macro processor to the FORTRAN 66
preprocessor (Wikipedia) to create a hybrid language extension named RATFOR (RATional FORtran).
The basic program constructions of this extension (conditions, cycles) are the same as in C language.
Programming in RATFOR is similar to C programming.
The macro processor converts the source code back to FORTRAN, then the compiler performs the usual compilation to machine code.

285
[M4 language complements C language]

285
Note the almost perfect symbiosis with the C language:

285
CPP (C preprocessor) directives , , , … are comments for M4

285
most keywords separated from parentheses by a white character lose meaning

for example, M4 ignores 


285
macro arguments separate commas just like commas in C functions

if the  macro is defined, its variables are:

, , , 



285
the left control character  is not a part of the C family syntax

285
the right control character  does not matter if it is not part of the macro

both control characters can be hidden into user-defined macros , 

285
macros are written , just like nonterminal symbols (Wikipedia)
this delimits their namespace

364
The user manual mentions other co-authors not mentioned here.
So it would be fairly unfair to write that the authors of the M4 macro processor (1977) are only two people.

GNU M4

394
Today, there are several implementations that differ from the original implementation rather by small details.
The most common implementation of M4 is the GNU M4 used for Autotools (Wikipedia)
and for translating the simple  configuration file to complex .
The author of this implementation (1990) is René Seindal.
To install m4 (with small letter „m“), type the following command:

409
[the command also installs other important packages]

413
A detailed description of the keywords can be found in the documentation:

427
Basics of M4

433
M4 is based on context-free grammar, automata, stacks and output queues.
To understand M4, it is therefore crucial to understand the basic concepts of formal language theory –
terminal symbols (Wikipedia) (briefly terminals) and nonterminal symbols (briefly nonterminals).
These terms will be explained later in more detail.
The objective is to show the basic practical use of M4 language on examples.

448
Context-free grammar

454
Context-free grammar (shortly CFG (Context-Free Grammar)) is a formal grammar in which all rules for rewriting have the  form.
The nonterminal  is rewritten to an arbitrarily long  (the right side of the rewriting rule) string composed of terminals  or nonterminals .
Kleene star (Wikipedia) means that nonterminal  can be rewritten to  (epsilon – empty symbol) (rewriting rule ).

465
[context-free grammar rewriting rules]

471
M4 rewriting rules

477
The rules for rewriting are the same for context-free grammar and M4.

484
[M4 rewriting rules]

493
All M4 keywords are nonterminals (macros), which take action and are rewritten to  (epsilon – empty symbol) or another symbol.
All keywords can be renamed or turned off completely.
This feature is crucial for the preprocessor mode.

504
[M4 keywords are nonterminals]

512
Nonterminal expansion control

518
The default character pair  in M4 controls the expansion of nonterminals.
The keyword  can change them to other characters, for example {(square brackets), (nonprintable characters), (UTF-8 characters)}.
The nonterminals that we do not want to (immediately) expand are surrounded by this pair of characters.
When passing through the macro processor, all the symbols between this character pair are terminal symbols and the outer character pair is removed.
The next pass will cause the expansion of the originally protected nonterminals.
The control character pair is set at the beginning of the root file.

536
Automata

542
Automata serve as „switches“ of grammar rules.
Automata use the grammar rules for rewriting as nodes and change their states according to input symbols.
The currently used rule produces a specific code to the output queue (or several output queues) until the automaton moves to another node with a different rule.
The examples of generating automata are in appendix.

557
Output queues

563
The output queues temporarily store the portions of the resulting code.
These parts are formed using the grammar rules for rewriting which subsequently rewrite input symbols.
The  keyword sets the output queue.
Finally, all non-empty queues are dumped in ascending order to the standard output and compose the final code.
The examples of the output queues are in the appendix.

579
[for information]

579
Stacks will be described later.

587
Main uses of M4

593
M4 is used to generate the source code of any programming language or as a preprocessor for any source code.

601
The code generation

607
M4 transforms input data from  (Macro Configuration) files to output data with the following command:

614
[← the_most_general.m4 … the_most_special.m4 →]

618
Two basic operations are performed during file loading:

625
the reading transformation rules from files with the  extension

625
the expansion of macros inside  files

643
The  and  files contain the input data in a format that allows them to be transformed into output data according to the rules in the previous  files.
The  data files usually do not contain any transformation rules.

652
The input data may also come from the pipeline:

659
[input code → source code generation → file]

663
[input code → source code generation → program]

667
Try: Code generation examples

675
The preprocessor

681
M4 can operate in the preprocessor mode and can also be part of a pipeline.
The input source code passes unchanged through except for nonterminal symbols.
The nonterminals found are expanded to terminals and the output along with the source code.
M4 can extend any other language where the preprocessor is insufficient (no recursion) or none.
It is important to select the left character for nonterminal expansion control, which must not collide with the input source code character.
However the character collision is easily solved by a regex.

698
[M4 as preprocessor – in general]

702
[M4 as preprocessor – without intermediate file]

707
 Default characters

713
The conflicting character  from the input source code is hidden into a macro .
An empty pair of control characters  before the macro serves as a symbol separator.
When the source code is passed through the macro processor, the  macro is rewritten back to the original  character and the empty pair  is removed.

727
[M4 as preprocessor with control characters: `']

731
If there are  or  comments in the source code, they must be hidden first.
The characters  turn off original meaning and will be removed by the macro processor.

M4  and  comments are hidden between default characters:  

742
[M4 as preprocessor with control characters: `']

746
[M4 as preprocessor with control characters differently: `']

751
 Square brackets

757
If square brackets are used to control the expansion of nonterminals, the left  square bracket is hidden in the same way.
Everything else applies as for default characters .

766
[M4 as preprocessor with control characters: []]

770
M4  and  comments are hidden between parentheses:  

777
[M4 as preprocessor with control characters: []]

781
[M4 as preprocessor with control characters differently: []]

786
 Non printable characters

792
Non printable characters  () and  () can be used to control the expansion of nonterminals.
These characters cannot interfere with printable source code characters.

801
[M4 as preprocessor with control characters: ␂␆]

805
M4  and  comments are hidden between non printable characters:  

812
[M4 as preprocessor with control characters: ␂␆]

816
[M4 as preprocessor with control characters differently: ␂␆]

821
 UTF-8 characters

827
Expansion of nonterminals can also be controlled by a suitably selected UTF-8 character pair.
The usual source code does not contain such characters, so we do not have to solve the collision of the left  bracket.
UTF-8 characters offer similar advantages to non printable characters.

838
[M4 as preprocessor with control characters: ⟦⟧]

842
M4  and  comments are hidden between UTF-8 characters:  

849
[M4 as preprocessor with control characters: ⟦⟧]

853
[M4 as preprocessor with control characters differently: ⟦⟧]

859
Try: Preprocessor examples

863
Mixed mode

869
The mixed mode is a combination of the previous modes and is mainly used for experiments.
The data is not separated from the rules for its transformation.
The leaf file  contains transformation rule definitions along with input data.

889
Prerequisites for mastering M4

895
To successfully master this macro language it is important to fulfill several prerequisites.
M4 is not a simple language because it is not possible to think and program in it like an ordinary programming language.
The most important thing to realize is that it is used to program the grammar rules for rewriting.
Each string is either a terminal or a nonterminal symbol, including all language keywords (the symbols  and  are special cases of nonterminals).

908
[note]

908
M4 intentionally does not have keywords for cycles (/) because its basis is quite different from procedural or functional languages.

908
loops are only left-recursive or right-recursive

908
branching is made by symbol concatenation or ,  keywords

940
Fundamentals of grammars

946
All grammars are based on the rules for rewriting and their forms are generally described:

953
Formal grammar (Chomsky type)

970
The Formal grammar (Wikipedia) describes the subsets (Chomsky hierarchy
(Wikipedie)) of the
formal language (Wikipedia)
rewriting rules and one of the subsets is called context-free grammar (Wikipedia),
shortly CFG (Context-Free Grammar).
As mentioned earlier, the CFG rewriting rules work the same as the M4 rewriting rules.
Some of the following episodes of this series will focus on formal grammar in detail.

990
Fundamentals of automata

996
The ability to use predominantly two-state automata is an essential thing for writing simple M4 scripts because the vast majority of scripts use small automata.

1003
Testing automaton

1009
The order of input symbols or their context can be tested by an automaton.
If the input symbols meet the required properties, the automaton ends up in a double-ring node which indicates the accepting state.

1018
[deterministic finite automaton (DFA)]

1018
Example of an automaton accepting an even number (none is even) of symbols , ignoring symbols .
The automaton is the same as the regular expression .

1033
The previous automaton can be written as an ASCII art accompanying the M4 script:

1040
[ASCII art for M4 code documentation]

1049
Generating automaton

1055
Input symbols change the nodes of the automaton, thereby changing the rewriting rules for code generation.
See the appendix for this generating automaton:

1064
[ASCII art of generating automaton]

1082
(GNU) make

1088
A well-designed code generator usually consists of several smaller files whose order, dependencies and parameters are written to the  file.
Good knowledge of  writing is therefore a prerequisite for mastering M4.
Reading and maintaining source code generally takes more time than creating it.
A well-structured  therefore significantly contributes to the overall clarity of the resulting code generator.

1101
[we will deal with this topic at another part]

1101
Executing  from the code editor with a shortcut key will significantly speed up M4 code development.
The file  contains .

1111
Vim

1117
Mastering the Vim editor is an important prerequisite for the convenience and speed of writing M4 code.
Vim shortcuts, defined by the  keyword, will save large amounts of unnecessary typing.
These shortcuts also significantly reduce the occurrence of almost invisible errors caused by an unpaired bracket, thus saving the lost time spent on debugging.

1129
Talent and time

1135
M4 usually cannot be mastered over the weekend, especially when the fundamentals of
automata theory (Wikipedia) and formal grammars (Wikipedia) are lacking.
In order to master the M4 language, it is necessary to program in a longer period of time and write amounts of bad (complex) M4 code that you rewrite for a better idea.
In this way it is possible to gradually gain practice.

1152

The examples in this appendix are more complex and are intended to demonstrate the practical use of M4.
They will be explained in detail later.

1168
 Input source code

1174
The input source code is similar to CSV (Comma Separated Values), which is converted to arbitrarily complex target code of another language using CFG (Context-Free Grammar), automata and output queues.
Stacks in the examples are not used.
The input source code contains special characters that must be hidden:

1187
The input file may also contain notes that may not be hidden in the comments , ,  or .

The example uses the  macro from the root file whose  (the right side of the rewriting rule) is copied to the right side of the  macro.

Further expansion returns the numeric terminal symbol and increases the inner auxiliary (global) symbol by one.
 is a small automaton.

1232
[]

1237
(how to do it) Modification of special characters

1243
Each type of output code requires the modification of the special characters.
The M4  keyword is inappropriate for this type of task.
First, we hide all special characters of the input file into appropriately named macros using regular expressions.

1254
Modified input code

1260
[all special characters are hidden into macros]

We create several conversion files according to the target code type,  and  macros for square brackets are already defined in the root file.

 C:  output queue

1319
The example uses one output queue for characters  to close the array at the end.

1331
 INI:  an external command

1337
The example runs an external  command and places its output in square brackets.
The output of an external command are two comma-separated items.
The  macro selects the first item because the second item contains an unwanted  () new line character.

1353
 .h:  hex counter

1359
The example uses the  macro to number the resulting CPP (C preprocessor) macros and one output queue.
The queue number  contains the preprocessor directive  to terminate the header file.
The decimal value of the counter is converted to the two-digit hex digit by keyword .

1370
[]

1375
 C:  small automaton

1381
The example uses a small automaton  to generate a newline  character and one output queue number  containing  characters to terminate resulting string.
Run the first time , is rewritten to  (epsilon – empty symbol), in all following ones, it is rewritten to .

1408
This example is similar to the previous one, but each string is on a new line.

1420
 HTML:  output queues

1426
The example uses two output queues.
The queue number  contains paragraphs.
The queue number  contains closing HTML tags.
Navigation links do not have to be stored anywhere, they go straight to the output.
The  and  messages are processed in the same way as the  messages.

1446
 Branching by grammar

1452
The example shows branching by grammar, macro arguments are ignored.
Input nonterminals are rewritten to terminals (🐛),
(🐜),
(🐝).

1467
[]

1474
 JSON:  generating automaton

1480
The example uses two output queues and one generating automaton.
The first  error message in the  state generates a header with brackets and outputs the first record.
The automaton goes to the state  which is a  rule (the rule is used as the right side of another rewriting rule).
The following error messages in the  state only output individual records.
At the end the output queue number  and number  print the characters  and  to close the resulting JSON.

1500
 JSON:  named queues

1506
The example processes other types of messages  and .
It uses three automata and six output queues.
If we generate more complex source code, we will soon encounter the problem of maintaining index consistency for output queues.
To avoid confusion, we use queue names instead of numbers.

1519
To avoid having to define similar rules, we copy the right side of  (it is also a  rule (the rule is used as the right side of another rewriting rule)) to the right side of the  and  rules.
The  variable is rewritten to the name of the macro and concatenated with another symbol.
The newly formed nonterminal is rewritten to the corresponding terminal symbol (queue number or name).

1530
[grammar branching in M4]

1545
 JSON:  generated queue indexes

1551
During development, the order and number of output queues often change, which also requires frequent changes of their indexes.
It is therefore appropriate to generate indexes.
We can then use a virtually unlimited number of queues.
The following example shows how these indexes are generated.

1570
 INI:  discontinuous queue index

1576
The example uses three automata and two output queues number  and  defined in a separate file.
INI section names are generated by symbol chaining.
The example uses the same file for output queues as the example to generate JSON.

1592
 XML:  mixed messages

1598
The example uses one output queue number  for the  closing tag.

 C preprocessor and M4

1662
The CPP (C preprocessor) directives are a one-line comment for M4 preventing unwanted expansion of the same named macros.
If we define a safer  macro, the similar  macro will not be overwritten.
Thus, the CPP (C preprocessor) namespace can be completely separated from the M4 namespace.
The problematic (backquote) character  is hidden in the  macro.
The apostrophe  does not matter in the source code.
Apostrophe inside  macro is hidden in  macro.
Note the  or  function names and where the  is expanded.

 CSS:  file inclusion, comment

1702
CSS uses the  character for color codes, which is also the beginning of a one-line M4 comment.
The  keyword sets a multiline  comment and rewrites itself into  (epsilon – empty symbol).
The comments can be turned off with the same  keyword without parameters.

The empty pair  (or the empty symbol in brackets ) serves as a symbol separator.
Brackets around the comment character  turn off its original meaning as well as the meaning of the more powerful M4 comment .
They also turn off the original meaning of the comma  as a macro argument delimiter.
These symbols become ordinary terminal symbols without any side effect.

Chars. {, , , } in the name controls the expansion of nonterminals.

1858
 Why to generate code in M4

1864
direct use of context-free grammar (recursion for free)
minimum M4 code is required for data transformation

1864
direct use of automata
possibility to model necessary algorithms (M4 does not need versions)

1864
direct use of stacks
stacks connected to automata extend capabilities of code generator

1864
direct use of output queues to temporarily store resulting pieces of code
individual queues are finally dumped to output in ascending order

1864
significantly faster code generation (compared to XSLT)
low demands on computing resources

1914
 Why to avoid M4

1920
low-level universal language (similar to C language)
in return it provides tremendous flexibility as UNIX

1920
(almost) nonexistent developer community (as of Autumn 2019)
M4 is nearly forgotten language with small number of existing projects

1920
unusual programming paradigm requiring several prerequisites
that is why the M4 can be considered a challenging language

1920
productivity greatly depends on experience (problem with short-term deadlines)
writing M4 scripts requires basic knowledge of automata and grammars

1920
maintaining badly written M4 code is not easy
existing M4 code is easily thrown into confusion (supervision required!)
